# sys-C
This is the implementation in C of a symmetric crypo system. The key is a 'rectangle of bits' with columns and rows that are rotated cyclically as a function of itself and the symbols of plaintext. Some more detail is provided in a pdf accompanying the source code.
The key varies in size along with the alphabet.
